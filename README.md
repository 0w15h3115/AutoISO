## Installation

1. Download the script:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/autoiso/main/autoiso.sh
chmod +x autoiso.sh
```

2. Or clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autoiso.git
cd autoiso
chmod +x autoiso.sh
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Interactive disk selection (recommended for first-time users)
./autoiso.sh

# Use specific directory
./autoiso.sh /mnt/external-drive

# Use environment variable
export WORKDIR=/home/user/iso-build
./autoiso.sh

# Show help
./autoiso.sh --help
```

### Common Examples

```bash
# Use external USB drive
./autoiso.sh /media/user/USB-DRIVE

# Use external SSD for faster builds
./autoiso.sh /mnt/external-ssd

# Use home directory (if sufficient space)
./autoiso.sh /home/user/iso-workspace

# Use mounted network storage
./autoiso.sh /mnt/network-storage
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Prepare Your System
```bash
# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install git if needed
sudo apt install git

# Download AutoISO
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autoiso.git
cd autoiso
```

### 2. Run AutoISO
```bash
# Start the build process
./autoiso.sh /path/to/build/location

# The script will:
# - Detect your distribution
# - Install required packages
# - Copy your system files
# - Create the bootable ISO
# - Provide usage instructions
```

### 3. Create Bootable USB
```bash
# Write ISO to USB drive (replace /dev/sdX with your USB device)
sudo dd if=/path/to/autoiso-persistent-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync

# Verify the write completed
sync
```

### 4. Create Persistence Partition (Optional)
```bash
# Create second partition using gparted or fdisk
sudo gparted /dev/sdX

# Format persistence partition
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L persistence /dev/sdX2

# Mount and configure persistence
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/persistence
sudo mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt/persistence
echo "/ union" | sudo tee /mnt/persistence/persistence.conf
sudo umount /mnt/persistence
```

## Boot Options

When booting from your USB drive, you'll see these options:

### For Ubuntu/Debian:
- **AutoISO Persistent Mode** (Recommended): Changes are saved between reboots
- **AutoISO Live Mode**: Traditional live CD behavior, no changes saved
- **AutoISO Safe Mode**: Use if you experience graphics issues
- **AutoISO to RAM**: Loads entire system to RAM (requires 4GB+ RAM)

### For Kali Linux:
- **Live (amd64)**: Standard live mode
- **Live (forensic mode)**: No swap, no automount for forensic work
- **Live USB Persistence**: Saves changes to persistence partition
- **Live USB Encrypted Persistence**: Encrypted persistence with LUKS

## Default Credentials

### Ubuntu/Debian:
- **Username**: `user`
- **Password**: `live`
- **Privileges**: User has sudo access

### Kali Linux:
- **Username**: `kali`
- **Password**: `kali`
- **Privileges**: User has sudo access

## Included Software

AutoISO includes essential software for a complete live environment:

### Base System:
- **Network**: NetworkManager, wireless tools, WPA supplicant
- **Browser**: Firefox ESR
- **File Manager**: PCManFM
- **Editor**: Nano
- **System Monitor**: htop
- **Base System**: Full Debian/Ubuntu base with live-boot

### Kali Linux Specific:
- All pre-installed Kali tools and frameworks
- Metasploit Framework
- Network analysis tools
- Forensics utilities
- Web application testing tools
- Wireless security tools

## Kali Linux Specific Notes

When building a Kali Linux ISO:

1. **Space Requirements**: Kali typically needs more space due to its extensive toolset. Plan for at least 20-25GB of free space.

2. **Boot Modes**: Kali offers additional boot modes including forensic mode which prevents any changes to the host system.

3. **Persistence**: Kali supports encrypted persistence for secure portable installations.

4. **Performance**: Due to the large number of tools, Kali ISOs will be larger and may take longer to build.

5. **Updates**: After creating your Kali ISO, you may want to update the tools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient space" error:**
```bash
# Check available space
df -h

# Use different disk
./autoiso.sh /path/to/larger/disk

# Clean up previous builds
sudo rm -rf /tmp/iso

# For Kali, remove unnecessary tool packages before building
sudo apt remove --purge kali-tools-gpu kali-tools-hardware
```

**"Kernel not found" error:**
```bash
# Check available kernels
ls -la /boot/vmlinuz*

# For Kali, ensure you have the linux-image-amd64 package
sudo apt install linux-image-amd64

# Update kernel packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

**USB not booting:**
- Verify ISO integrity: `md5sum your-iso-file.iso`
- Try different USB port or USB drive
- Check BIOS/UEFI boot settings
- Ensure USB drive is bootable
- For Kali, ensure Secure Boot is disabled

**Persistence not working:**
- Verify persistence partition is labeled correctly: `sudo blkid`
- Check persistence.conf file exists and contains `/ union`
- Ensure partition is ext4 formatted
- For Kali, use the persistence boot option

### Performance Tips

- **Use SSD**: Build on SSD for faster compilation
- **External Drive**: Use USB 3.0+ external drive for better performance
- **RAM**: More RAM helps during build process (8GB+ recommended for Kali)
- **CPU**: Multi-core systems build faster due to parallel compression

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Exclusions

Edit the `EXCLUDE_DIRS` array in the script to customize what gets excluded:

```bash
EXCLUDE_DIRS=(
    "/dev/*" "/proc/*" "/sys/*" "/tmp/*"
    "/your/custom/exclude/path"
    # Add more exclusions here
)
```

### Custom Packages

Modify the chroot section to install additional packages:

```bash
# In the chroot section, add:
apt-get install -y your-package-name
```

### Boot Menu Customization

Edit the `isolinux.cfg` creation section to customize boot options and appearance.

### Distribution-Specific Customization

The script automatically detects your distribution and applies appropriate configurations. You can add support for additional distributions by modifying the `validate_distribution()` function.

## Security Considerations

- **Sensitive Data**: The ISO contains a copy of your system. Remove sensitive files before building
- **Passwords**: Consider changing default passwords in the live system
- **Network**: Live system includes network tools - secure accordingly
- **Updates**: Regularly update the base system before creating ISOs
- **Kali Specific**: Be aware that Kali includes powerful security tools - use responsibly

## FAQ

**Q: How long does it take to build an ISO?**
A: Typically 30-60 minutes depending on system size and storage speed. Kali may take longer due to its size.

**Q: Can I create an ISO of a different system?**
A: No, AutoISO creates an ISO of the current running system.

**Q: Will my personal files be included?**
A: No, user home directories are excluded by default for privacy.

**Q: Can I run this on other Linux distributions?**
A: Currently optimized for Debian/Ubuntu/Kali. May work on derivatives with modifications.

**Q: How do I update an existing live USB?**
A: Create a new ISO and re-write it to the USB drive. Persistence data is preserved if using a separate partition.

**Q: Can I create multiple ISOs from the same system?**
A: Yes, each build is timestamped and can coexist.

**Q: Does it work with UEFI systems?**
A: Yes, the ISO supports both BIOS and UEFI boot modes.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial purposes?**
A: Yes, but ensure you comply with the licenses of all included software.
